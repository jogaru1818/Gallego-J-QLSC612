# README file

**This readme file briefly describes how to install the necessary dependencies for the code presented in the Jupyter Notebook of my repo for assignment 1.
It also describes how to run the code and what outputs are expected**

## Requirements

-Everything is embedded into a Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/) written in Python language (https://www.python.org/).

-To be able to run this you will need to have a Python version higher than 3 installed. For machines with linux it is usually
already installed. 

-You can manage different versions in your computer using pyenv (https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#using-different-versions-of-python).

-Alternatively, as performed here, you can install a particular Python version on a conda environment (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

-Then you need to install Jupyter dependencies using conda or pip install, depending what you are using (https://jupyter.org/install).

-Finally we will be using different python tools that we will have to install import to run our scripts, these include:
-pandas
-numpy
-matplotlib.pyplot
-stats from scipy
-HTML from IPython.display
-seed from numpy.random
-randint from numpy.random


-The Jupyter notebook contains only 15 cells (first and last without code) and each step is explained in there. After installing the required dependecies, 
it should not be a problem to run it very easily and quicky. 
-You should be able to see the updated dataframe structure after running cells 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7
-You should be able to obtain 2 scatter plots after running cells 8 and 12
-You should be able to see a gif after running cells 10 and 14
-Check if you browser supports gif format to display gifs.
